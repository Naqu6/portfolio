	Utilizing Python for Business Growth

		My first internship was at the software startup Taplytics. There, I worked with the business and growth teams researching potential clients. The work was all based around using information stored in spreadsheets to perform a specific task, such as getting information off a website or filling out a form. I decided to use programming to attempt to increase the efficiency of this process.

		Over the summer, I built various web scrapers and spreadsheet processors for them and streamlined a significant number of manual tasks. This allowed their employees to focus their resources elsewhere and helped grow their business.
