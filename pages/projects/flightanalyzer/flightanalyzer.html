		To be certified as a Pilot, you are required to preform a large number of maneuvers within very specific tolerances. During my training, I wanted to tool that would give me statistics about different flights and my maneuvers during them. I wasted plenty of my time repeating the same mistakes and I wanted a tool to help me identify the issues I was having.

		There are plenty of solutions available, however, they are all quite expensive and I saw an interesting challenge that I could create a solution too.

		Using <i>Cesium</i> as a base, I built a web tool that processes KML flies that I record during each flight and displays them on a 3d-map. Additionally, it provides tools to analyze each section of the flight. After every flight, I'll use this tool to debrief.
