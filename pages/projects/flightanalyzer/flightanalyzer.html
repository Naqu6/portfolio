	Lightweight Flight Analyzer

		To be certified as a Pilot, you are required to perform a large number of maneuvers within very specific tolerances. During my training, I wasted plenty of my time repeating the same mistakes and I wanted a tool to help me identify the issues I was having.

	<p>
		There are plenty of solutions available, however, they are all quite expensive and I saw an interesting challenge in building a custom flight analyzer.
	</p>

	<p>
		Using Cesium as a base, I built a web tool that processes KML flies that I record during each flight and displays them on a 3D map. Additionally, it provides tools to analyze each section of the flight. After every flight, I use this tool to help me debrief.
