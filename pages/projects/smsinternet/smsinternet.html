	<p>
		For my Computer Science Capstone Project, I decided to do something a bit unconventional. My goal was to connect a mobile device (in this case, a Samsung S5 Mini) to the Internet - just using text messages.

		There were two main reasons for me to decide to do this - first was the challenge. I was inspired to do something unconventional with my knowledge. The second was the possible application. In areas with poor data coverage but adequate SMS coverage, a device could be connected to the Internet.

		Development
	</div>

	<p>
		My test device was a standard Samsung S5 Mini. To capture outgoing network traffic and input incoming traffic, I built an android application that would create a VPN on the device. It would then use SMS to forward the outgoing packets to a server which would then send the packets appropriately. When the server received Internet Traffic, it would forward the packets back to the devices (via SMS, of course). The application would then treat the packet as if it had been received over traditional channels.

		Results

	<p>
		In the end, I was able to connect my device to the Internet, albeit quite slowly. I've found that building unconventional, even silly, projects like this strengthen my computer engineering knowledge because I need to really understand the fundamentals of how the computers work to be able to build the product.
