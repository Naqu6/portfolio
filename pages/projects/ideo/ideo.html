	Designing a Modern Concept Management System
</div>

<div class="project-description">

	<p>
		For years, the <a href="http://www.ideotoylab.com">IDEO Toylab</a> used a legacy PHP system to store their toy concept information. Although there were effective tools, the database was becoming bloated and the system's age was showing. Currently, as a software engineer at IDEO, I'm responsible for designing and building the new system.

		Avoiding Second System Syndrome

	<p>
		Because the old system had been in use for decades, the designers and managers were very accustomed to it. I wanted to ensure that the new system didn't lose any functionality and improved upon the issues that plagued the old software.
	</p>

	<p>
		Initially, researched how the main users of the software used it. I ensured that I fully understood how the software was used. This encompassed spending time working with the old software to get an additional perspective on what worked and what didn't.

		Initial Development
	</div>

	<p>
		My first task was to get the core functionality of the software written in a more modern language with a cleaner database structure. I decided to use Python and Django. Django is a Python Library that utilizes a SQL database and allows software to be built quickly. Their motto is "the web framework for perfectionists with deadlines".

	<p>
		While building the initial product, I worked with interaction designers at IDEO. We designed a new interface and new work flows, keeping some of the old features as well as designing new ones.

		Implementation

	<p>
		Once the leads were satisfied with the new product, the Toylab switched to the new system. The old database was structured very clearly, so writing the scripts to migrate over the media and database was a large task. I spent a lot of time reading through legacy PHP code to understand how the database was formatted. Additionally, there was no consistent method in which the media was stored which added to the complexity of the migration script.

		Currently, I'm working with the Toylab Invention Lead to design new features. I'm developing more web features and an iOS mobile application.
