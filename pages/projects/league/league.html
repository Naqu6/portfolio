	Increasing the Effectiveness of Customer Support Tools

		A large part of League’s business is managing health and wellness benefits for other companies. Rather than submitting paper claims, claims are submitted digital claims using League’s mobile application or website. Although these claims are faster than traditional insurance claims, they still can take a few days for a customer care agents to process. The goal of my project was to improve the efficiency of the claims processing.

	<p>
		The first step of this project was determining what was the most effective solution to the problem. I talked with the Director of Business Operations to determine what was the most time consuming part of processing these receipts. We decided that the most effective initial step would be to build a computer vision program that would be able to pull key information from images of health care receipts

		When a claim was submitted, the code would scan the image and extract the information about the health claim. A digital image is, at its core, a matrix containing matrices of numbers. The first step is pre-processing the image: removing noise and backgrounds from the image. I utilized a <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/sparis/bf_course/">Mean Gaussian Filter</a> to remove the noise. Once the noise had been removed, a binary matrix represents the image. Then, I had the program group the relevant information into sub-sections for text parsing. I now had sections of pixels ready to be turned into text.
	</p>

	<p>
		Converting pixels into text is a process called optical character recognition, or OCR. I experimented with two ways of doing this. The first way we tried was “training” our program with test data images where we already knew the text. However, because all of the health receipts are protected under <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html">HIPAA</a>, the production logging and data security requirements are extraordinarily strict, so using production data as training data was not a viable option.
	</p> 

	<p>
		Instead of using in-house OCR software, for the initial prototype I decided to a standalone OCR library. Using a library like this still allowed us to help the program improve and didn’t require a significant amount of test data.
	</p>

	<p>
		The final part of the program is the text parsing. This part of the program used the text we extracted from the image to create data that can improve claim processing. To determine the information in the parsed text, I designed an algorithm that uses relative locations of keywords to determine information such as the price and the service provider. Given correct text information, the algorithm accurately finds the receipt total and service provider.

		Implementation

	<p>
		Once the CTO and Director of Business Development were happy with the effectiveness of the software, we implemented the software to pre-fill the form fields for the customer care agent when validating receipts. The first iteration of the software wasn’t very effective. Due to the inaccuracies in the OCR, the health care provider was often found incorrectly. However, the date and total were found correct an appropriate percentage of the time. An additional drawback was how highly resource intensive the OCR and image processing was on the production servers. 
	</p>

	<p>
		In addition to using computer vision software, I helped design and build a more effective user interface tools for the customer support agents. We went through multiple iterations of interfaces and determined what would show the most pertinent and useful information.
	</p>

	<p>
		Because of the inaccuracies of the OCR Library, I decided to outsource the OCR. Rather than converting the images to text on League's servers, we would use a 3rd party service and parse the receipts ourselves. 

		I completely rewrote the vision software within our the back-end application, rather than the initial standalone micro-service. It was significantly more efficient and cost effective. Thorough testing clearly showed that this was the better solution, and we decided it was ready to be implemented in a production environment.

	<p>
		In the end, the computer vision software combined with the more effective user interface resulted in a significant decrease in claim processing time and a significant increase in customer support productivity.
