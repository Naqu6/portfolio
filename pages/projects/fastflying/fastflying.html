		Inspiration

	<p>
		As a licensed Pilot, I love flying. I am lucky to be able to experience and enjoy General Aviation on a regular basis. However, for most people, airline travel is not an experience they look forward to - it is plagued with expensive tickets, difficult airlines, long lines, and lost baggage.

		After a couple of particularly frustrating commercial airport experiences, I set out to explore solutions to congestion at airports.

		Development

	<p>
		I built an algorithm that uses the manifests of a set of flights to queue up the passengers and then inform them when to arrive at the airport. Instead of having to guess what time to arrive at the airport to be able to make a flight, specific times will be assigned to each passenger. Rather than waiting in lines, there would be an airline employee ready to check them in and take their luggage. Once they've cleared security, an application on their phone will inform them what time they're supposed to board, rather than having to get to the gate an hour before the departure time.

		I spent a couple of months building a web-app, an iOS application, and an Android application.

		Implementation
	</div>

	<p>
		After sending some emails, I came in contact with an executive at United Airlines. We setup a call, and I gave them my pitch. However, after they heard my age they explained to me that they weren't really interested in improving efficiency in airports and that their "research showed that people really enjoyed standing in lines at airports".

		Although I didn't achieve the outcome I would have liked from this project, I enjoyed working on this algorithm and application.
