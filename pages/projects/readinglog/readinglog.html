	Inspiring Students to Expand Their Literary Horizons

<div class="project-description">
	My first project that was used by a large number of people was simple reading log I built. In Middle School, every few we had to fill out a reading log. For each book we read, we had to log the title, date we completed the book, number of pages, and a paragraph long summary. This was annoying for us but even worse for my teacher. She had to go through hundreds of pieces of paper and keep track of who read how much. I decided to try to help solve this problem. I built a simple website that would allow us (the students) to log us each book we read and write a simple summary. We could then see what other Student's were reading and get recommendations from them. Then, the teacher would have a quick view of all the students and how many pages they read. Although the code was quite primitive (and messy) it ended up working and saving everyone time. My teacher ended up using it for all her classes until she retired.
