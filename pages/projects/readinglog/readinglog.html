		I love reading. There’s nothing like having the words of a book create a new world in your head that you lose yourself in for hours.

		In middle school, I’d always be thrilled when it was time to fill out our “reading logs”.  At the end of every quarter, we would “log” all of the books we read on a piece of paper and then write a short summary of each. I tried to formulate my paragraph long summaries to be as intriguing as possible so in the two minutes before we turned in the reading logs I could pitch the books I’d read to my classmates. 
		My teacher didn’t share in my excitement. After the paper reading logs came up in an after class discussion about books, she explained to me how she had to manually calculate average number of pages and books read for each of her classes, and go through hundreds of pieces of loose paper to determine if each student had read the necessary number of books, wasting hours of her time.

		After I walked out of that class I was hit with a brief streak of inspiration. I envisioned a digital reading log where students could log their books and see what books their classmates had read, a digital reading log that would do all the math for my teacher so all she would need to check her student’s reading status is click a button.

		For about a month, every day after I finished my homework I spent my hours building a new, digial reading log. Using the Python Library Django as a backend, I built a website where students could log in, log books, and see what their peers were reading.

		Once I was happy with what I built, I showed it to my teacher after class. She had a few questions, but was generally happy with it.
