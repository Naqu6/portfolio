						Computer Vision Engineering Intern

						September 2016 - July 2017

				<div class="description">
					During my Sophomore Year of High School, I interned remotely for League. My project was to use Computer Vision to help automate an aspect of their business. During my internship there, I independently build computer vision software in Python and Golang that utilized Opencv and Tesseract. Additionally, I worked in the capacity of a full-stack engineer implementing the Computer Vision Software I wrote and designing a new interface. This involved using Golang, MongoDB, JQuery, CSS, and HTML. 

					The software I wrote was built to support the Customer Support team, which resulted in me working closely with the Head of Customer Service.
