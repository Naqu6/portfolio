				<div class="description">
					During my Sophomore Year of High School, I interned remotely for League. My project was to use Computer Vision to help automate an aspect of their business. During my internship there, I independently build computer vision software in Python and Golang that utilized Opencv and Tesseract. Additionally, I worked in the capacity of a full-stack engineer implementing the Computer Vision Software I wrote and designing a new interface. This involved using Golang, MongoDB, JQuery, CSS, and HTML. 

					The software I wrote was built to support the Customer Support team, which resulted in me working closely with the Head of Customer Service.

					Over the time period of a year, I volunteered for the Palo Alto High School branch of the Heroic Imagination Project. The "Heroic Imagination Project" is a project designed to improve mental health, make academic information more available, and train hero's. I build software to help them test ways to effectively convey their information. The curriculum and presentation that I helped work on there is now a critical part of a class at Palo Alto High School that is required to be taken by every student there.
