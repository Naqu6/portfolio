					Middle School Reading Log
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="project-information">
				My first project that was used by a large number of people was simple reading log I built. In Middle School, every few we had to fill out a reading log. For each book we read, we had to log the title, date we completed the book, number of pages, and a paragraph long summary. This was annoying for us but even worse for my teacher. She had to go through hundreds of pieces of paper and keep track of who read how much. I decided to try to help solve this problem. I built a simple website that would allow us (the students) to log us each book we read and write a simple summary. We could then see what other Student's were reading and get recommendations from them. Then, the teacher would have a quick view of all the students and how many pages they read. Although the code was quite primitive (and messy) it ended up working and saving everyone time. My teacher ended up using it for all her classes until she retired.

					The "SMS" Internet
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="project-information">
				As a freshman in high school, I signed up for an intermediate-level programming class. However, it was quickly apparent that I was not going to learn anything from that class (they were planning to talk about conditions and loops for the first three months). I tried to move into the advanced placement class, but, because I was a freshman, they did not allow me to take the class. After some discussion with the computer science teacher, I decided to take the Capstone Computer Science class, a class historically only taken by Seniors and “very advanced” juniors.   The class was completely project based, so each student had a year long project they pursued. The projects were supported by the Computer Science teacher, a former NASA programmer who has an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and a graduate degree in Physics, both from MIT. In addition to his support, part of the class was finding professional software developers who could serve as mentors.  The projects that other students did were quite diverse. One built an unbeatable checkers AI, another one wrote a program to write music, and someone turned a kindle into a display for his computer. At the time, I had unlimited SMS texting but limited data so I decided to build an app to connect my phone to the Internet without using data.  The project was two-fold. First, I built an app that would capture all of the internet communications and forward it through SMS. I built this application to work on a production Android device that was not rooted or modified in any way. Then, I used a third-party service (Twilio) to capture the SMS texts and forward it to my server. The server would then connect to the Internet and forward the packets appropriately. Once Internet communication was received, it would be texted back to the device and forward appropriately.   Although the software worked, it was quite slow and ineffective. It was an interesting project because I was able to do a lot of interesting research to try to make this work and make computers talk to each other that didn’t really want to. I really enjoyed building this and learned a lot from it (although the name SMS Internet is pretty lazy).
