			I'm Ryan. I’m the oldest of 4 siblings. Growing up, we moved from San Fransisco to Toronto to Vancouver to Palo Alto. I started programming in third grade after I moved to California, initially learning Python through Code Academy with my Dad. He burnt out once the topic of arrays came up, but I quickly branched out, teaching myself Java and learning about networking from <i>Programming for Dummies</i> books. 
			

			<br> <br> 

			I’ve continued programming since, building side projects and working professionally. I started interning at 13, and have been working since.  At 5 different companies, I've worked in Golang, Java, Objective-C, Swift, PHP, Python, and Javascript (JQuery) in environments build around databases such as MongoDB and MySQL.

			<br> <br>

			I lead my first two professional engineering projects during my internship at League, the first of which was an internal tool that automated the writing of Web Unit Tests. <a href="#"> The second of which </a> was a larger-scale computer vision project aimed to help increase automation.

			<br> <br>

			Since my internship at League, I've done <a href="#"> Freelance Web Development </a> and <a href="#"> used my engineering knowledge to help various local community service organizations </a>.

			<br> <br>

			Personally, I spent a lot of my own time working on side projects. I’ve taught myself more languages than I can count. Often, my evenings are spend fiddling with projects or learning a new programming language.

			<br> <br>

			In addition to coding, I’m an avid rock climber, skier, and an FAA licensed Private Pilot. I've been climbing since I was 13 and flying since I was 14. I flew a plane alone before I drove a car alone. If I'm not programming, I'm probably doing something slightly dangerous at a high altitude.

			<br> <br>I also enjoy playing with my dog and going on hikes with my parents.
