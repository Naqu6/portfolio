		<div class="bio-text">
			I'm Ryan. I’m the oldest of 4 siblings. Growing up, I lived in Toronto, Vancouver, and Palo Alto. I started programming in third grade when my Dad wanted to learn Python through Code Academy. He burnt out once the topic of arrays came up, but I quickly branched out, teaching myself Java and learning about networking from <i>Programming for Dummies</i> books. 
			

			<br> <br> 

			I continued programming, building side projects and working professionally. I started interning at 13, and have been working since.  At 5 different companies, I've worked in Golang, Java, Objective-C, Swift, PHP, Python, and Javascript (JQuery) in environments built around databases such as MongoDB and MySQL.

			<br> <br>

			I lead my first two professional engineering projects when I was 15 during my internship at <a href="https://league.com"> League </a>. The first of which was an internal tool that automated the writing of Web Unit Tests and <a href="/projects/league/"> the second </a>a larger-scale computer vision project aimed to help increase automation. Since that internship, I've done <a href="/projects/freelancing/"> Freelance Web Development </a> and used my engineering knowledge <a href="/projects/hip/">to help various local community service organizations</a>. Currently, I'm employed part time as a Full Stack Software Engineer at <a href="https://ideo.com">IDEO</a>.

			<br> <br>

			Personally, I spent a lot of my own time working on side projects. I’ve taught myself more languages than I can count. Often, my evenings are spend fiddling with projects or learning a new programming language. In addition to coding, I’m an avid rock climber, skier, and an FAA licensed Private Pilot. I've been climbing since I was 13 and flying since I was 14. I flew a plane alone before I drove a car alone. If I'm not programming, I'm probably doing something adventurous at a high altitude.

			<br> <br>I also enjoy playing with my dog and going on hikes with family.
